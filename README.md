# HR-EMPLOYEE-DATASET
INTRODUCTION:
This dataset provides insights into employee attrition and workforce dynamics by examining factors such as department, role, income, and personal characteristics. The dashboard brings these patterns to light, showing the key reasons employees leave the organization.

Objectives:
1.	To identify vulnerable employee groups based on income, travel demands, and job satisfaction.
2.	To highlight patterns in performance ratings and compensation across different departments.
3.	To provide data-driven insights that can support workforce planning and retention strategies.

Data Source:
The dataset used for this analysis is the HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset, a publicly available dataset designed for research and learning purposes. It contains employee demographic details (such as age, gender, marital status, and education), job-related information (department, role, performance rating, job satisfaction, travel frequency), and compensation details (monthly income, daily rate, hourly rate). 
Methodology:
This dataset was cleaned and analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Charts were created by Power BI used to give summaries and show visualization of the analysis. Using SQL, targeted queries were applied to extract insights and answer specific business questions. The analysis includes groupings of job roles, daily rate, gender, performance rating, job satisfaction, monthly income, business travel and marital status

Data analysis and findings:
1.	In the Sales department, a small group of married female employees who travel frequently earn less than 10k monthly. This highlights an imbalance between workload and compensation, potentially driving dissatisfaction.
2.	A cluster of employees show Performance Ratings below 3 and Job Satisfaction below 1, while earning only 10k monthly. This group poses a significant attrition risk and may need urgent engagement.
3.	In Research & Development, there exists a group of employees with Daily Rates above 1200 and salaries above 10k. These represent high-performing and highly compensated employees.
4.	Conversely, employees over age 50 in research and development who travel frequently but earn less than 5k monthly face both financial stress and work-life imbalance, making them a priority group for well-being interventions.

Conclusion:
The analysis of employee demographics and workplace factors highlights clear patterns influencing attrition risk across the company. Married female employees in Sales who travel frequently with lower income appear particularly vulnerable, reflecting the strain of balancing workload and compensation. Employees with low job satisfaction and performance ratings also stand out as a group requiring attention, as they signal disengagement and dissatisfaction.
Within Research and Development, two distinct groups emerge: highly compensated top performers with higher daily rates, and older employees facing low pay despite demanding travel schedules. This contrast highlights the diverse and challenging workforce dynamics within the department. 
Overall, the findings suggest that compensation fairness, workload balance, and employee satisfaction remain key drivers shaping retention and performance outcomes. Addressing these areas holistically will strengthen the companyâ€™s ability to maintain a motivated, stable, and engaged workforce.
